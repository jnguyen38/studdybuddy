## StudyBuddy

Notre Dame's first study aid for students to find study spaces around Notre Dameâ€™s campus.  The app contains a hand collected database of all possible study spaces on campus, and recommends study spaces to users according to various filters selected.  The app aims to help students find new study spaces they may not have visited before, as well as find central study spaces for group projects or convenient locations for studying near food options.

ReactJS App created with CRA and hosted on Notre Dame's db8 studnet machine Apache server. The app is connected to a SQL database.
